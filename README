Wireless Config
A 802.1x configuration suite for Mac OS X
Currently This suite is in Beta testing

wifiutil.py
Is a 10.5,10.6,10.7 Wireless configuration command line tool

example usage:
sudo ./wifiutil.py --username=bob --password=f00b4r --plist='/path/to/wifiutil.settings.plist'
or debug:
sudo ./wifiutil.py --username=bob --password=f00b4r --plist='/path/to/wifiutil.settings.plist' -d

This script has support for removal and addtion of WPA2E networks.
Technically it has support for WPA too but this only works really well on 10.6+

WirelessConfig.bundle:
A Casper self service plugin, see this document for scoped installation:

Otherwise you can upload through the JSS portal but not recommended while this in Beta.

kcutil:
A keychain binary because 10.5 is stupid and I hate it, please upgrade.

wifiutil.settings.plist:
Two arrays, to add and remove networks
Note this is excluded from the build process, check the downloads section for examples

To Do:
Currently the script requires trusted Certificates be configured through
some other process. This will eventually be embeded in a future release.

This is currently PEAP centric (plist key 25) but needs further testing with other 
parameters ,including multiple authentication options.
