Otherwise you can upload through the JSS portal but not recommended while this in Beta.

To Do:
Currently the script requires trusted Certificates be configured through
some other process. This will eventually be embdeded in a furture release.

This is currently PEAP centric (plist key 25) but needs further testing with other 
parameters ,including multiple authentication options.
